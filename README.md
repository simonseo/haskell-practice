# Haskell Practice

I'm following along on an NYU Shanghai's [Functional Programming course taught by Professor Paul Mellies](http://functional-programming-in-haskell.org/). We're using Haskell. 

I like it so far because it stimulates my brain to think in a rather new way compared to how I've been oriented to think for the past 6 years of programming.

The slides are good to get an overview-level understanding of the material but I've been learning the most from doing the homework and reading through this amazing instruction book online: [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).
